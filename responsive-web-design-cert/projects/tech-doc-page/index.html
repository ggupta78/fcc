                <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is, how the browser turns HTML into a Document Object Model (DOM), how CSS is applied to parts of the DOM, some very basic syntax examples, and what code is used to actually include our CSS in our web page.</p>

                <p>As we have mentioned before, CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.</p>
                <p>A document is usually a text file structured using a markup language — HTML is the most common markup language, but you will also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.</p>
                <p>Presenting a document to a user means converting it into a usable form for your audience. Browsers, like Firefox, Chrome or Internet Explorer, are designed to present documents visually, for example, on a computer screen, projector or printer.</p>

                <p>Web browsers apply CSS rules to a document to affect how they are displayed. A CSS rule is formed from:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A set of properties, which have values set to update how the HTML content is displayed, for example, I want my element's width to be 50% of its parent element, and its background to be red.</li>
                    <li>A selector, which selects the element(s) you want to apply the updated property values to. For example, I want to apply my CSS rule to all the paragraphs in my HTML document.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A set of CSS rules contained within a stylesheet determines how a webpage should look. You will learn a lot more about what CSS syntax looks like in the next article of the module — CSS Syntax.</p>
                <p>The above descriptions may or may not have made sense, so let's make sure things are clear by presenting a quick example. First of all, let's take a simple HTML document, containing an h1 and a p (notice that a stylesheet is applied to the HTML using a link element):</p>
                <code>
                h1 {
                    color: blue;
                    background-color: yellow;
                    border: 1px solid black;
                }
            
                p {
                    color: red;
                }
                </code>

                <p>When a browser displays a document, it must combine the document's content with its style information. It processes the document in two stages:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The browser converts HTML and CSS into the DOM (Document Object Model). The DOM represents the document in the computer's memory. It combines the document's content with its style.</li>
                    <li>The browser displays the contents of the DOM.</li>
                    <li>and so on....and on...and on....</li>
                </ol>
            </section>
            <section id="About_the_DOM" class="main-section">
                <header>About the DOM</header>
                <a name="About_the_DOM"></a>
                <p>A DOM has a tree-like structure. Each element, attribute and piece of text in the markup language becomes a DOM node in the tree structure. The nodes are defined by their relationship to other DOM nodes. Some elements are parents of child nodes, and child nodes have siblings.</p>
                <p>Understanding the DOM helps you design, debug and maintain your CSS because the DOM is where your CSS and the document's content meet up.</p>
